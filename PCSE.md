## **Results**

The results of this pilot study indicate that the intervention impacted predictions of future stress. Those in the experimental group expected the fictional character to be more successful in controlling future stress than the dialogue control group, with the visual control group’s perceived control falling between. 

_Perceived Control over Stressful Events (PCSE) Analyses for all participants_

*	A 3(group: experimental, visual, dialogue) x 2(time: baseline & post-intervention) mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) on perceived control found main effects of group (p < .001, η²p = 0.16) and time (p < .001, η²p = 0.08). 

*	These results indicate that overall perceived control increased from baseline to post-intervention for all conditions as well as differentially across condition. The effect sizes were moderate for the main effect of time and large for the main effect of group. 

*	As predicted, the dialogue control group had the smallest changes in perceived control (non-significant contrasts) across the three conditions. In contrast to my prediction that the experimental group would experience larger increases than the visual control group, the biggest changes were in the visual control group.

_PCSE Analyses for Neuroticism Subsets_

*	In a subset (N = 60 from additional targeted recruitment) of participants with higher neuroticism, I conducted an exploratory 3(group) x 2(time) mixed factorial ANOVA and compared it to an ANOVA on participants with low neuroticism (N = 54). In the high neuroticism subset, there was a main effect of time (p < .001, η²p = 0.12) and group (p = .025, η²p = 0.29), while there were no main effects or interactions in the low neuroticism subset (All p’s > .05). 

*	These results indicate that the intervention across conditions was more effective for participants with high neuroticism than participants with low neuroticism. Specifically, it seems as though the participants with high neuroticism drove the effects of group and time on all participants, as the high neuroticism subset had larger effect sizes. 

*	Experimental and visual control groups experienced significant increases in perceived control while the dialogue control group did not in high neuroticism subset post-hocs. 

_Further analyses_

*	I conducted a planned multiple linear regression examining the predictive abilities of the Big 5 personality facets on baseline cognitive distortions. Lower neuroticism (reverse scored: β = -0.38, p < .001), extroversion (β = -0.23, p = 0.02), low conscientiousness (reverse scored: β = -0.23, p = 0.012), and low openness (β = 0.25, p = 0.005) predicted lower cognitive distortions, model R2adj = .264). Agreeableness did not significantly predict baseline cognitive distortions. These results suggest that low neuroticism, high extroversion, low openness, and low conscientiousness may serve as “protection” against cognitive distortions. 

*	Other planned and exploratory analyses were conducted with the following dependent variables: Inventory of Cognitive Distortions, a final comprehension test, and the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory. These analyses are available upon request. 

## **Conclusion**

*	Overall improvements in perceived control over stress for the fictional character, and the experimental group tended to predict higher perceived control than the dialogue control group. Contrary to predictions, the experimental group did not have larger changes in perceived control over the visual control group, though both did have larger improvements in perceived control than the dialogue group. 

*	Personality factors predicted cognitive distortions and specifically, in a high neuroticism subset, participants predicted a greater amount of perceived control. 

*	Results are promising for both the utility of engagement strategies in online treatment and of a brief, single session online stress management intervention. 

*	A follow up study in 2021 will examine a revised quizzing/comprehension test in a high neuroticism subset.
